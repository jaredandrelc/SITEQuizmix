&$T: MATCH
&$Q: Match the term to its correct definition.
&$O: A pictorial form of a truth table used to simplify Boolean functions. | K-Map (General Definition)
&$O: A set of exactly 2^m adjacent cells containing ones or zeroes. | Subcube
&$O: Cells that are identical except in one variable. | Adjacent Cells
&$O: A combination of variables whose logical value is not specified (marked with 'X'). | Don't Care Condition
&$E: The Karnaugh Map is a pictorial form of a truth table. A subcube is defined as a set of adjacent cells. Adjacent cells are identical except in one variable. Don't Care conditions occur when a logical value is not specified.

&$T: MC
&$Q: [Grouping Rule] When grouping cells in a K-Map, the number of cells in a group must always be:
&$O: An odd number (1, 3, 5, 7)
&$O: *A power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...)
&$O: Any even number (2, 4, 6, 8...)
&$O: A multiple of 3
&$E: You must always group adjacent cells in powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).

&$T: MC
&$Q: [Mapping Types] If you are mapping 1s (Ones) onto the K-Map, which representation form are you deriving?
&$O: POS (Product of Sums)
&$O: *SOP (Sum of Products)
&$O: BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)
&$O: XOR Sum
&$E: 1s are placed in the squares to represent minterms for the SOP (Sum of Products) form.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Mapping Types] If you are mapping 0s (Zeroes) onto the K-Map, which representation form are you deriving?
&$O: *POS (Product of Sums)
&$O: SOP (Sum of Products)
&$O: Canonical Minterm Form
&$O: Universal Logic
&$E: 0s are placed in the squares to represent maxterms for the POS (Product of Sums) form.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Constraint] Which of the following grouping methods is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in a K-Map?
&$O: Overlapping groups
&$O: Wrapping from left to right (rolling the map)
&$O: *Diagonal grouping
&$O: Grouping four corners
&$E: Diagonal grouping is not allowed.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Optimization] What is the primary objective when forming groups in a K-Map to ensure the simplest expression?
&$O: Maximize the number of groups.
&$O: Make groups as small as possible.
&$O: *Maximize group size and minimize the number of groups.
&$O: Avoid overlapping any groups.
&$E: The objective is to maximize the number of elements in a group (make it large) and minimize the total number of groups.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Structure] How many cells (squares) does a standard 4-variable K-Map contain?
&$O: 8
&$O: 12
&$O: *16
&$O: 32
&$E: The number of cells is 2^n. For 4 variables, 2^4 = 16.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Don't Care] How can a "Don't Care" (X) be used during the grouping process?
&$O: It must always be treated as a 0.
&$O: *It acts as either a 0 or a 1, whichever helps maximize the group size.
&$O: It must strictly be ignored.
&$O: It forces the output to be inverted.
&$E: An X is placed within the cell and acts as either a 0 or a 1 to maximize the number of elements per group.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [History] Who developed the K-Map method in 1953?
&$O: George Boole
&$O: *Maurice Karnaugh
&$O: Augustus De Morgan
&$O: Claude Shannon
&$E: It was developed by Karnaugh in 1953, presenting it in his paper "The map method for synthesis of combinational logic circuits".
