&$O: 7400 | Quad 2-Input NAND Gate
&$O: 7402 | Quad 2-Input NOR Gate
&$O: 7404 | Hex Inverter (NOT Gate)
&$O: 7408 | Quad 2-Input AND Gate
&$O: 7432 | Quad 2-Input OR Gate
&$O: 7486 | Quad 2-Input XOR Gate
&$E: 7400=NAND, 7402=NOR, 7404=NOT, 7408=AND, 7432=OR, 7486=XOR.

&$T: MC
&$Q: [Logic Levels] In digital systems using Binary Logic, what voltage level typically represents a "TRUE" or "1" state?
&$O: 0V (Low)
&$O: *5V (High)
&$O: 2.5V (Neutral)
&$O: -5V (Negative)
&$E: A "TRUE" state corresponds to a binary "1" or "5V" (HIGH) level.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Universal Gates] Which of the following is considered a "Universal Gate" because it can be used to build any other gate?
&$O: AND Gate
&$O: XOR Gate
&$O: *NAND Gate
&$O: NOT Gate
&$E: NAND is a "Universal Gate," meaning you can build any other gate (like AND, OR, NOT) by connecting NAND gates in specific patterns.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Gate Definition] Which gate outputs a 1 ONLY if all inputs are 1?
&$O: OR
&$O: NAND
&$O: *AND
&$O: XOR
&$E: The AND gate operation is "Logical Multiplication" where the output is 1 only if all inputs are 1.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Gate Definition] Which gate outputs a 1 if the inputs are DIFFERENT (e.g., one is 1, the other is 0)?
&$O: XNOR
&$O: *XOR
&$O: NOR
&$O: AND
&$E: The XOR (Exclusive-OR) gate outputs 1 if inputs are different (inequality). If inputs are the same, it outputs 0.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Gate Definition] Which gate is known as the "Inverter"?
&$O: Buffer
&$O: OR
&$O: *NOT
&$O: NAND
&$E: The NOT gate is also called an Inverter. It performs complementation.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Precedence] When evaluating a Boolean expression without parentheses, which operator has the HIGHEST priority?
&$O: OR
&$O: AND
&$O: *NOT
&$O: XOR
&$E: The standard order of precedence is: 1. NOT (Highest), 2. AND, 3. OR (Lowest).
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Logic Construction] How do you create a NOT gate using a NOR gate?
&$O: Connect the output to the input.
&$O: *Join the two inputs of the NOR gate together into a single input.
&$O: Connect one input to 5V.
&$O: You cannot create a NOT from a NOR.
&$E: To build a NOT/Inverter from a NOR gate, you join the two inputs together. Logic: (A + A)' = A'.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Gate Definition] What is the specific function of a Buffer gate?
&$O: It inverts the signal.
&$O: It performs logical addition.
&$O: *It creates no logic change but amplifies the signal.
&$O: It outputs 0 always.
&$E: A Buffer performs no logic change (A * 1 = A) but is used to amplify the signal.
**
&$T: MC
&$Q: [Logic Definition] The XNOR gate is strictly defined as the inverse of which gate?
&$O: OR
&$O: NAND
&$O: *XOR
&$O: AND
&$E: XNOR (Exclusive-NOR) is the opposite of the output of XOR. It outputs 1 if inputs are the same (Equivalence).
**
&$T: MC
